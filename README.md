Basic_webpage.zip contains the necessary files to start a basic webpage using Django. 
To test this project, extract the compressed folder into the location of your choice. Then,
open your command prompt and change your current directory to where the files are saved.

Once you are in the correct directory, you should see another folder with the same name and 
a .py file called "manage". Enter this command: "python manage.py runserver" and you should 
start a local server on your machine. Copy the URL found in the sentence "Starting
development server at..." and paste into your web browser. You should see a success message once
the site loads. 

Additionally, you can append "/admin" to the copied url and you will see the default login page!
